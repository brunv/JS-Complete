# Using ES6, NPM, Babel and Webpack

# NodeJS and NPM
To init the project just type 
``` npm init ```
and answer some questions to properly set it.

We have two types of NodeJS packages:
- libraries and frameworks (jQuery, React...);
- development tools (Webpack...);

## Webpack
To install Webpack, enter:
``` npm install webpack --save-dev ```
